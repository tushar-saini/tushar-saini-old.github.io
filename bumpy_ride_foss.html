				Journey Through The World Of Open Source

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an article on <a class = "nostyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">FOSS</a> or anything like that, but the story of my journey in the world of open source. This was something which was long due and I am glad, at last, I am doing it.<p>

				<h3>How it started:</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, the entry point to the world of awesomeness was from google GSOC's program[<a class = "nostyle" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">what's that</a>]. When I started, I was very nervous about, being capable enough to work with such big organizations. And I thought I wouldn't stand a chance. With these doubts in mind, I still dived in. Reading various resources and doing some research of my own, I thought Mozilla will be the best place to start my contribution(And It was the best decision I had ever made).<p>

				<h3>First  Bug:</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By going through several resources provided on Mozilla's developer site  I was able to built fennec(firefox for android). There were some issues which I faced, but folks on Mozilla's IRC channel helped me to solve those. Next stop was to choose a bug. Mozilla provides Bugzilla to search for bugs and there are some bugs having a tag of "good-first-bug", which are simple and helps newbies to understand the workflow. I chose my first bug which was mentored by Michael Comella and Sebastian Kaspari. They provided me with a lot of help. They answered every query I asked. (now when I recall it, some of them were really dumb) I screwed up several times, but with the help of the mentors, I was able to resolve those issues. After that, I had worked on various other bugs, mentored by different people and all of them were very humble.[They are really busy people and still, they take out some time to answer our queries]<p>

				<h3>Failure :</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not able to land in GSOC this time. But nonetheless, this failure had taught me a lot, I learned a lot of new things, (which I doubt I had ever learned if not for this). My advice to those who do not get selected in GSOC is not to bother yourself much and try next time. Also, remain engaged with orgazization, as it has its own perks and benefits.<p>

				<div class="text-center quote-style">"Failure is key to success; each mistake teaches us something."</div><p><br>

				<h3>So why you should contribute?</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than helping the organization to make things open and free, you will learn new things every day. I personally believed that being engaged in OSS, have helped me to grow my knowledge. Each bug I have resolved has taught me something. Also, it was the sense of pride for me, that my commits are part of the software which is being used by millions of people.<p>

				<h3>How much knowledge is needed?</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we talked about the awesomeness of OSS and why to contribute. But the first question which comes to mind  "How much knowledge is needed?" I want to break it you that even with some basic knowledge of programming language, you can start contributing. You can always learn while doing things. It's really okay to not know everything. <p>

				<div class="text-center quote-style">"The person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."</div> <p><br>

				<h3>So whom to choose?</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay so, there are so many open source organizations, so whom to choose. Every organization is unique in their own way.  Every organization's technical need is different, so it will also depend on your skill-set. You have to do some research by yourself. Choosing organization depends solely on you. But rest assured, work culture is same, they always welcome new contributors.<p>

				<h3>What have I learned while contributing?</h3><p>

				To name a few things which I have learned while contributing to Mozilla are:<p>
				<ul class = "anchor-style">
					<li><a class = "nostyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control</a></li>
					<li><a class = "nostyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_relay_chat">IRC</a></li>
					<li>Build tools.</li>
					<li>Learned a lot programming wise.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Special Thanks to open source maintainers:</h3><p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, I want to thank all those people who have made my experience in FOSS world so amazing and wonderful.<br>

				<div class="text-center">Thanks for reading!!</div>
